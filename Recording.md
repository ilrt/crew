# Introduction #
The Recorder enables the recording of both Access Grid events and offline events; the same interface can be used for both of these types of event.  The Recorder must be downloaded to the computer that it is to record events from.

## Annotating Recordings ##
The Event Recorder also starts in the background a Web server that allows the Recorded session to be annotated. These "Live-Annotations" are timestamped comments provided by the Session Audience. The Live-Annotations will appear in the CrewPlayer alongside the recorded  video streams.

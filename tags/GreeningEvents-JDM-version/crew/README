The CREW build is managed by Maven 2. To comile and build CREW
you will need to have Maven 2 installed:

    <http://maven.apache.org/download.html>

You need to ensure that the bin/ directory of your Maven installation
is set on your PATH variable.

Install the different modules into your local maven repository:

    cd Crew/
    mvn install

This might take a few minutes to download all of the third party
libraries that are used by CREW.

You can then run CREW with some test data from the CrewWeb module:

    cd CrewWeb
    mvn jetty:run

This will download jetty and run the servlet container on port 9090.
You should be able to access crew via:

    <http://localhost:9090/Crew>

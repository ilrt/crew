THE AS2LIB FRAMEWORK, release 0.9.3 (July 2005)
-----------------------------------------------
http://www.as2lib.org


1. Introduction:

   The As2lib is an open source framework targeted to Macromedia Flash MX 2004+ developers. It offers
   support for basic idioms like event handling, error handling, logging, overloading and reflections
   as well as different kinds of data holders and iterators. Also contained is a full-featured testing
   framework that allows for unit tests, mock objects and speed tests, an input/output (io) framework
   and an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) framework.
   This release's highlights are the new regular expression (RegExp) framework and the revised file and
   process frameworks.
   We aim to offer support for almost every problem domain in future releases including beans, contexts
   and everything else you ask for. We thus encourage you to submit a Feature Request if there is a feature
   you are missing or to post about this feature in the Discussion Forum or on our Mailing List.

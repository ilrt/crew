                <h3>Collaborative Research Events on the Web (CREW)</h3>

                <p>CREW (Collaborative Research Events on the Web) aims to improve access to
                    research event content by capturing and publishing the scholarly communication
                    that occurs at events like conferences and workshops. The project is developing
                    tools to enable presentations and similar sessions to be recorded and annotated
                    and enable powerful searches across distributed conference and related research
                    data. Searches will yield results within written documents such as abstracts and
                    papers and also in rich audio-visual content, such as clips from presentations
                    or questions asked at a talk.</p>

                <p>The project is a collaboration between the Universities of <a
                        href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/">Manchester</a>, <a
                        href="http://www.bris.ac.uk">Bristol</a> and <a
                        href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk">Wales, Bangor</a> and is funded by the <a
                        href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Joint Information Systems Committee</a> (JISC)
                    through the second phase of the <a
                        href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/vre2/projects.aspx">Virtual
                    Research Environments (VRE) programme</a>. The project builds upon the success
                    of <a href="http://iugo.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/">Iugo</a> and <a
                        href="http://www.memetic-vre.net/">Memetic</a> by developing and integrating
                    these technologies and embedding them in a variety of authentic research
                    settings, including <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk">Intute</a>, a national
                    JISC service to provide access to web resources for research to UK universities,
                    the <a href="http://www.ihs.manchester.ac.uk/">Institute of Health Sciences</a>,
                    which promotes health sciences research in Manchester and scientific
                    visualization research groups.</p>


                <!--
                <p>CREW is funded by JISC within the second phase of the
                <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/programme_vre.html">Virtual Research Environments</a>
                (VRE) programme and is a collaboration between the Universities of Manchester and
                Bristol. It is managed by<a href="http://www.mc.manchester.ac.uk/about/people/daw">Michael Daw</a>.</p>

                <p>CREW is a project that builds on the success of two phase 1 VRE projects,
                <a href="http://iugo.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/">Iugo</a> and <a href="http://www.memetic-vre.net">Memetic</a>,
                by developing and integrating these technologies and embedding them in a variety of authentic
                research settings, including <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/">Intute</a>, a national JISC service
                to provide access to web resources for research to UK universities, and the
                <a href="http://www.ihs.manchester.ac.uk/">Institute of Health Sciences</a>, which promotes
                health sciencesresearch in Manchester. Integration of Iugo and Memetic technologies will enable the
                capture of the scholarly communication that occurs at research events (e.g. conferences and workshops)
                to create lasting research resources from material that is often ephemeral.</p>

                <p>Iugo has developed a semantic web application that organises and allows access to the disparate
                content and information related to conferences and workshops. Memetic has developed a tool that
                records and annotates <a href="http://www.accessgrid.org">Access Grid</a> sessions allowing
                flexible and navigable playback. The integration and development of these tools will enable
                presentations and other types of sessions to be recorded and automatically annotated to become
                discoverable in context, enabling powerful, single-point multimedia searches across distributed
                conference and related research data. Searches will yield results within written documents such
                as abstracts and papers and also in rich audio-visual content, such as clips from presentations.</p>

The Recorder enables the recording of both Access Grid events and offline events; the same interface can be used for both of these types of event.  The Recorder must be downloaded to the computer that it is to record events from.

The Event Recorder also starts in the background a Web server that allows the Recorded session to be annotated. These "Live-Annotations" are timestamped comments provided by the Session Audience. The Live-Annotations will appear in the CrewPlayer alongside the recorded  video streams.

The ReplayLayout defines the look of the CrewPlayer. A Crew user can Define different layouts to be used for the Player. These ReplayLayouts define replay positions, i.e. positions where a video or metadata stream is displayed. A ReplayLayout is defined in the layouts.xml file as described below. 

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<layouts>
    <layout name="CrewDefault">
        <element name="Video" x="30" y="30" width="240" height="196"/>
        <element name="Screen" x="285" y="30" width="720" height="540" has-changes="true" />
        <element name="Annotation" x="30" y="245" width="240" height="325" assignable="false"/>
        <element name="Slider" x="120" y="580" width="885" height="175" assignable="false"/>
        <element name="Controls" x="30" y="580" width="100" height="20" assignable="false"/>
    </layout>
</layouts>
}}}

Each replay position has a position `x="`*`<number>`*`" y="`*`<number>`*`"` and its dimensions `width="`*`<number>`*`" height="`*`<number>`*`"` assigned.   

The xml file defines different kinds of replay positions: 
  * *assingable*  
  an assignable replay position displays a video stream. Each video stream has a name assigned that matches the stream name of a recording. The assingment of these names is done in the [Recording event recorder]. 
  * *predefined*  
  a predefined replay position `assignable="false"` is used for elements used for standard tasks the current crew-player defines three such tasks:
    * *Controls*

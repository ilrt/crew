The ReplayLayout defines the look of the CrewPlayer. A Crew user can Define different layouts to be used for the Player. These ReplayLayouts define replay positions, i.e. positions where a video or metadata stream is displayed. A ReplayLayout is defined in the layouts.xml file as described below. 

{{{

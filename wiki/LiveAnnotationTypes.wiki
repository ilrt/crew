= Introduction =
The default configuration file for the live annotation types provides the following types
<table>
<tr><td>[http://crew.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/LiveAnnotations/types/question.png]</td><td>*Question* 

The question annotates a question in the presentation or during a question and answer session. This only provides a single multi-line input box for the question.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[http://crew.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/LiveAnnotations/types/answer.png] </td><td> *Answer*

The answer type is there to capture the answers to a previous question. This type again only provides a single multi-line input box for the answer.</td></tr>
<tr><td> [http://crew.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/LiveAnnotations/types/comment.png] </td><td> *Comment* 

The comment type is for general comments made during the presentation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>[http://crew.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/LiveAnnotations/types/important.png] </td><td>*Important Point*

The important point can be used to highlight special remarks or show that the presenter put emphasis on certain issues. 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>[http://crew.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/LiveAnnotations/types/link.png] </td><td>*Linked Resource*

A linked resources is a more complex annotation. This provides input boxes for a *_name_* and a *_URL_* of the resource. It also provides the multi-line input box for the user to give a comment on the resource that is annotated. If the user does not specify the *_name_* or the *_URL_* the annotation will be converted into a *Comment*.  
</td></tr>
<tr><td>[http://crew.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/LiveAnnotations/types/person.png] </td><td>*Person*

A person annotation provides input boxes for the *_name_*, an *_email_* address and a *_URL_*. It also provides the multi-line input box for the user to give a comment. 
If all the text fields are left blank the annotation will be converted into a *Comment*. 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>[http://crew.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/LiveAnnotations/types/slide.png] </td><td> *Slide* 

The slide annotation is to define slide titles or the general content summary of a slide. These annotations are assigned to the timestamp of the previous slide change that is calculated by the recording tool.  
</td></tr></table>

[DefiningLiveAnnotationTypes Other types] can be defined by the user through the modification of the liveannotations.xml file.
